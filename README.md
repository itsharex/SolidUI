# QuickStart

[Quick Start](https://cloudorc.github.io/SolidUI-Website/docs/user-guide/quick-start/)

# What's this?

With the rise of language models for generating images from text, SolidUI wants to help people quickly build visualization tools. The visualization content includes 2D, 3D, and 3D scenes, so as to quickly construct 3D data presentation scenes. SolidUI is an innovative project that aims to combine natural language processing (NLP) with computer graphics to realize the function of Vincent diagram. By building a self-developed Wensheng graph language model, SolidUI uses the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback) process to realize the process from text description to graph generation.

## Self-developed Wensheng graph language model

SolidUI's Vincent graph language model is a deep learning model that can convert natural language descriptions input by users into specific graphical representations. This model is trained on a large amount of text and graphics data, and learns the mapping relationship from text to graphics. To achieve this goal, SolidUI's self-developed Vincent graph language model has the following characteristics:

* Combining NLP and computer graphics to realize the process from text description to graphic generation
* Can handle various types of graphics, such as 2D, 3D and scenes, etc.
* The model training process involves a large amount of text and graphics data to ensure the quality and accuracy of the generated graphics

## RLHF process

SolidUI uses the RLHF (Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback) process to optimize the performance of the Vincent graph language model. The process leverages human feedback to guide the model's learning process, enabling the model to better meet user needs. The main steps of the RLHF process include:

* Collect Feedback: Users rate the generated graphs, providing feedback on the quality and accuracy of the graphs.
* Updating the model: Based on the feedback collected, the model is updated using reinforcement learning algorithms to improve the quality and accuracy of the generated graphics.
* Iterative optimization: The process of collecting feedback and updating the model is repeated until the model performance reaches a satisfactory level.

Through this process, SolidUI's Vincent graph language model is able to continuously learn and improve from user feedback, producing graphics of higher quality and accuracy.
